				<h1>Maintaining Your Site for Long-Term Success</h1>
				<p class="subcontent">The day your company web site goes online can be very exciting, but that day
					isjust the start of a long haul success strategy. To get the most out of your web site, you need
					tomaintain and manage your web space.</p>
				<p class="subcontent"><b>This can involve:</b></p>
				<ul class="subcontent">
					<li>Changing the content on your web site so that it is clear that the site is active and
						itup-to-date. This is very important for search engine rankings, especially.</li>
					<li>Changing the look of your web site to reflect company changes and new products or services
						youare offering.</li>
					<li>Including time-sensitive information, such as information about industry changes,
						personnelchanges, and new events.</li>
					<li>Adding new web pages. You may archive current pages or past newsletters or you may add new
						pagesto reflect new ideas or products you are offering.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="subcontent">A web site is truly an ongoing work it is never static for long. For this
					reason,you want to make sure that you can make needed changes to your web site easily. You may want
					to hiresomeone in your company to take care of daily changes. This person may have some HTML or
					webexperience. You may not even have to hire someone new. Since updates to an existing site may
					takeonly a few minutes each day, someone who already works for you may be happy for the
					addedresponsibility.</p>
				<p class="subcontent">If there is no one in your company who can update your web site, consider
					havingcoding added to your web site that allows you to change only some parts of each page. This
					makes itvery easy to update certain parts of a page when you need to without hiring someone new.</p>
				<p class="subcontent">Of course, if you are in a fast-moving industry or if your company is booming,
					youmay need to make changes often and you may need those changes to be fairly large. In that event,
					youmay want to consider whether your web design firm offers management and maintenance services.
					Somequality web design companies including the California-based Indexideas will work with you to
					find asolution that is cost-effective and still allows you to make the changes you need to make to
					yourweb site.</p>
