				<h1>Branding</h1>
				<ul class="subcontent">
					<li><b>Does your company stand out or does it blend in amongst all the other companies that provide
							similar products and services?</b></li>
					<li><b>Is your business just another company, or have you clearly defined what makes you superior to
							the competition?</b></li>
				</ul>
				<h1>The concept we’re discussing here is referred to as branding.</h1>
				<p class="subcontent">Establishing your brand means clearly defining who your company is, what services
					and products you supply, what kind of service your customers can expect, and how you are better than
					the rest. Branding is wrapping all those elements into a <a
						href="logo-design-custom-logo-design-business-logo-design-services.html">logo</a>, slogan, and
					theme so your business is not just another company listed in a directory.</p>
				<h1>What Makes You So Special?</h1>
				<p class="subcontent">And yes, we are asking that with a bit of a sarcastic tone, because that’s what
					your potential customers are asking when they first come across your listing, website, logo or
					advertisement. Competition is stiff, and you must clearly establish your brand through your logo,
					marketing materials, and website or you won’t win clients.</p>
				<p class="subcontent">You need a logo, website, and marketing materials that all scream “We’re the
					best!” Our graphic designers know how to express your brand through a well-designed logo, website
					and marketing materials.</p>
				<p class="subcontent"><b>Determine what sets you apart from the rest – often referred to as your unique
						sales concept – and decide how you can best broadcast your selling points to the outside world.
						For example:</b></p>
				<ul class="subcontent">
					<li>If you own a restaurant, is your chicken sandwich the absolute best in town? What specifically
						makes it so special?</li>
					<li>If you run a movie house, what makes you unique? Are you the only place in town that shows
						independent and foreign films? Do you have vintage theater seating and staging? Do you still
						provide dollar popcorn?</li>
					<li>If you run a translation service, do you have the most obscure languages covered of all
						translation sites? Do you specialize in native language speakers?</li>
					<li>If you’re an online college, how are your e-courses superior? Do you provide interactive
						tutorials? Can students self-test?</li>
				</ul>
				<h1>But How Do You Translate That Concept Into Brand?</h1>
				<p class="subcontent">That’s where we come to the rescue.</p>
				<p class="subcontent">At IndexIdeas.com, we have expert <a
						href="website-design-web-development-marketing-materials-services.html">graphic design artists,
						web designers</a>, and marketing specialists who will help you transform your unique selling
					concept into a logo, theme, and design for your website and marketing materials.</p>
				<p class="subcontent"><b>Your branding materials need to express the following things about your
						business:</b></p>
				<ul class="subcontent">
					<li>Tone or attitude of your business. Think of three brands – McDonalds, PF Chang’s and Olive
						Garden. You know exactly what you can expect from all three of those restaurants before you walk
						through the door, right?</li>
					<li>Quality of products and services provided.</li>
					<li>Commitment to customer satisfaction. </li>
				</ul>
				<h1>That Sounds Like a Lot of Work. Is it Worth the Time and Money?</h1>
				<p class="subcontent">Imagine you are a potential customer, considering spending money on whatever goods
					or services your business provides. Now open the phone book and look at the many competitors listed.
					Does your listing or advertisement stand out?</p>
				<p class="subcontent">Now google your category of business online. Check out the competition’s brand.
					When you compare your logo and website design, do you stand a chance?</p>
				<p class="subcontent">Finally, check out your marketing materials. Have you received any brochures, ads
					or email campaigns from competitors lately? Compare your marketing materials to the competition, and
					decide for yourself if brand is important.</p>
				<p class="subcontent"><b>Is establishing your brand through your website, logo and marketing materials
						important?</b> You bet it is. Consider the small cost of establishing your brand an investment
					in increased sales for years to come.</p>
