				<h1>Copywriting Services</h1>
				<ul class="subcontent">
					<li><b>Are you good at running your business, but not so good at writing about your business?</b>
					</li>
					<li><b>Would you rather mop floors than have to write content for your website?</b></li>
					<li><b>Do you hate staring at that blinking cursor on your empty computer screen?</b></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="subcontent">Let us help you. At IndexIdeas.com, we love to write copy. In fact, we have a
					whole department devoted to it, manned by expert copywriters who actually enjoy writing copy for
					websites and marketing materials.</p>
				<h1>Need to Drive More Traffic to Your Site? SEO Copywriting</h1>
				<p class="subcontent">Our copywriters understand SEO (search engine optimization), so when we write your
					website content, we optimize your materials to improve your index ratings. We use tools to determine
					keywords and key phrases that should occur in your content, and we use the appropriate keywords at
					the desired frequency while still writing copy that is human readable (meaning the writing is still
					pleasant for people to read, not only optimized for maximum search engine indexing.) We understand
					how to employ techniques such as maximizing headings and bolding of particular text in order to draw
					both human eyes and spiders from search engines to your keywords and key phrases. When we write copy
					for your website, we make sure it benefits you in multiple ways</p>
				<h1>Launching an Email Campaign?</h1>
				<p class="subcontent">More and more businesses are launching email campaigns because email is an
					inexpensive, efficient way to reach your customers when they are home, relaxed, and ready to receive
					your materials. Make sure your email campaigns are well-designed, since there’s nothing more
					irritating than opening an email and feeling like you’ve just been spammed. </p>
				<p class="subcontent"><b>Here are some suggestions for a successful email campaign:</b></p>
				<ul class="subcontent">
					<li><b>Make sure your emails are welcome.</b> Always get permission from customers when you gather
						their contact information and provide an easy opt-out so they can opt not to receive your ads if
						they wish. You want to entice your customers to use your products or services, not annoy them
						until they can’t stand you.</li>
					<li><b>Make your email informative, entertaining, or useful.</b> Do not just spam out ads to your
						customers. If you write an email that is somehow of use to the recipient, you increase your
						chances of them reading your emails and add value to your advertising. Many businesses do this
						by sending out newsletters or interactive emails that double as online games or surveys.</li>
					<li><b>Limit the number of emails you send out.</b> Don’t irritate your customers!</li>
					<li><b>Include coupons, information about sales, or some sort of incentive in every email.</b> You
						need to give the customer a valid reason to read your emails.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="subcontent">Our copywriters know how to write effective direct marketing copy for email
					campaigns, employing either a soft or hard sell, as you see appropriate. Our expert copywriters will
					communicate with you so they understand the tone and message you want to convey</p>
				<h1>Direct Mail Copywriting</h1>
				<p class="subcontent">If you are employing local store marketing techniques, you may want to launch a
					neighborhood direct mail campaign highlighting your value to the community. </p>
				<p class="subcontent"><b>Our copywriters can write direct mail materials that accomplish the
						following:</b></p>
				<ul class="subcontent">
					<li>Showcase your value to the community</li>
					<li>Highlight your superior products and services</li>
					<li>Provide valuable coupons or savings</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="subcontent">If your product reaches a certain niche, you also may want to purchase market
					research and specific lists so you can get information out to your target market about your products
					and services. Our writers are experts in copywriting for businesses, selling your ideas, products
					and services to your niche market. We take the time to understand your business and the targeted
					demographic so our niche copy results in increased sales</p>
				<h1>Multi-faceted Business Copywriting Services</h1>

					for print or electronic copy.</p>
