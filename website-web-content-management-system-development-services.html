					easily. A content management system gives you, the site administrator, the ability to monitor and
					control the quality of content, increase the interactive nature of the content, and increase search
					engine optimization of content posted on the site.</p>
				<h1>What Kind of Content Would I Want on My Site?</h1>
				<p class="subcontent">In today’s world, many business owners rely on current, interesting content to
					bring Internet users to their sites. Some sites post SEO-friendly articles to their site, hoping to
					increase indexing. Others host blogs and other social networking platforms to encourage frequent
					site visits and as an effort to network with other Internet users who might have interests that jive
					with their business.,</p>
