        <h1>Why Your Business Needs an Internet Marketing Strategy</h1>
        <p class="subcontent"><b>Where do customers search when they need information?</b><br /><i>The Internet.</i></p>
        <p class="subcontent"><b>Where do customers look for new products?</b><br /><i>The Internet.</i></p>
        <p class="subcontent"><b>Where does your business need a strong presence?</b><br />You got it! On the Internet.
        </p>
        <p class="subcontent">Today marketing on the Internet is essential. The more Internet visibility your company
          has, the more paying customers you’ll have. It’s as simple as that.</p>
        <p class="subcontent"><b>What are the advantages of marketing through a website?</b></p>
        <ol class="subcontent">
          <li><b>Expand your market</b> - Once you establish a presence online, you become more than a local business.
            Suddenly the whole world is your target market! Literally a globe of people can have access to information
            about your products and services.</li>
          <li><b>Very little overhead cost</b> - Compared to a brick and mortar store, a quality website is very
            inexpensive. You can open an e-commerce store or direct customers to your physical business by providing
            information. Either way, by designing a website, you advertise in a cost-effective way that will pay off in
            dividends over the years.</li>
          <li><b>More business</b> - The natural result of cost-effective marketing that reaches more potential
            customers is more business, which means more income!</li>
          <li><b>Better branding</b> - A well-designed website can establish your brand more clearly than a logo alone
            or limited printed marketing materials. You can provide informational articles, detailed descriptions of
            your goods and services, and a clear depiction of who your company is through a website.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Everybody else is Doing It</h1>
        <p class="subcontent"><b>Here are some suggestions for getting started:</b></p>
        <ol class="subcontent">
          <li><b>Create a website</b> - If you are not technical, consider hiring a quality web designer to do the job
            for you. Get quotes from several web designers and find the one that will build the best quality, customized
            website that will convey your business message.</li>
          <li><b>Educate yourself on Internet marketing strategies</b> - The Internet is full of suggestions as to how
            to succeed – even in Internet marketing! Read articles, take courses, check out books on the subject. There
            are many companies that specialize in how to use the Internet to your best advantage.</li>
          <li><b>Get the information about your company out there!</b></li>
        </ol>
