        <h1>WebSite and Web Page Design</h1>
        <ul class="subcontent">
          <li><b>Are you disappointed with your web site design?</b></li>
          <li><b>When you refer friends and new clients to your site, do you cringe?</b></li>
          <li><b>Do you find yourself making excuses about how it's 'not quite done yet'?</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="subcontent">You're not alone. Most web sites stink, even the ones created by highly-paid web
          designers. The majority of the web pages out there have the following problems:</p>
        <ul class="subcontent">
          <li>Hard to navigate</li>
          <li>Not user-friendly</li>
          <li>Confusing</li>
          <li>Ugly design</li>
          <li>Poorly organized</li>
          <li>Over-designed so you can't find what you need</li>
          <li>Under-designed so you have to jump through hoops to get to the pages</li>
          <li>Unreadable</li>
          <li>Too complex for the user to understand what services you actually provide</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="subcontent">Does your website make you proud and bring you business? </p>
        <p class="subcontent">Or is it simply a never-ending, frustrating work in progress?</p>
        <h1>Truly Excellent Web Page Design</h1>
        <p class="subcontent">Here at IndexIdeas.com, we're committed to providing solidly superior web page design. Web
          design is a complicated discipline, and there is a delicate balance to maintain between designing for
          aesthetics and designing for function.</p>
        <p class="subcontent">We know how to design your website so it is aesthetically pleasing while still functional.
          At the same time. Amazing, we know. That's why our clients keep coming back for more work. We really know what
          we're doing.</p>
        <h1>Your Clients Will Love Your Site</h1>
        <p class="subcontent">The whole purpose of web design is to facilitate communication between you and the user,
          allowing your client to quickly and easily understand what products and services you provide and why your
          company is so much better than all the rest of those yahoos out there vying for their patronage. If your
          website design is obscure or cryptic or tough to navigate, you'll lose those customers faster than you can say
          'please give us another chance!'</p>
        <p class="subcontent"><b>We design web pages so they:</b></p>
        <ul class="subcontent">
          <li>Communicate your products and services clearly</li>
          <li>Provide a strong call to action</li>
          <li>Facilitate online sales</li>
          <li>Look hot (or cool, or pretty, or totally psychedelic ' whatever you want)</li>
          <li>Are readable and easy to follow</li>
          <li>Are easy to navigate</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Don't Try This at Home</h1>
        <p class="subcontent">If you've been designing your own website, you've probably already figured out that those
          web design templates available out there for cheap are perfect examples of that saying, 'You get what you pay
          for.' Those web design templates were created to work for the most basic of sites, ones that don't need any
          cool features like custom shopping carts or e-commerce. If you've been pulling your hair out at home trying to
          make your site do all the things you want it to, let us give you a hand.</p>
        <h1>Why Our Web Page Designs Rock </h1>
        <p class="subcontent">We pride ourselves in tailoring your site to exactly what your business needs. Companies
          of all sizes trust our services because we know how to determine what your site needs in order to serve your
          business best.</p>
