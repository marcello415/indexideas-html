				<h1>Top Signs Your Company Needs to Hire a Web Design Firm</h1>
				<p class="subcontent">If you notice any of the following red flags, it is time to start hiring a web
					design firm your companys success might depend on it:</p>
				<ol class="subcontent">
					<li>You are getting calls from customers saying I looked at your website, but This is a sure sign
						that you website is not answering your customers questions. Every such comment you get is
						actually a mark of lost money, since your website should have answered the question your
						customer had but did not, meaning that the customer is now taking up your time. If the website
						had done its job, the question would have been answered and you could have focused on something
						more productive.</li>
					<li>You are paying for a marketing firm or PR professionals but have no workable web site. If you
						can afford any sort of marketing or advertising, you can afford a web design firm which can make
						your marketing efforts far more successful. In todays business environment, there is no excuse
						not to have a website,</li>
					<li>Your web site has not been updated for weeks and you have no idea how to update it. A web design
						firm can ensure that you can always populate your site with fresh content.</li>
					<li>Half of the links on your website do not work. This virtually guarantees that visitors will
						simply click over to a competitor. If you are unable to create a workable website yourself, turn
						it over to a professional web design firm.</li>
					<li>Most of your business is repeat business. If you are not getting many fresh leads and customers,
						it is time to branch out to ensure your companys survival. If you are not getting new business
						and some of your repeat customers stop patronizing your business, your company could fail. A web
						design company can help ensure that your business attracts Internet surfers and even customers
						from around the world.</li>
					<li>You are ready to grow as a business but your company just does not seem to be expanding. A
						website is a very cost-effective way to expand your business and secure greater profits.</li>
					<li>You cannot state in a few succinct words what the purpose and goal of your website is and how
						your website is doing achieving that goal. If you are not sure what you are aiming for with your
						website, you are unlikely to achieve real results a good web design company can ensure that your
						website is online for a reason and actually meets your goals.</li>
